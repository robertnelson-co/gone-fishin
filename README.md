# gone-fishin
# Thank you for checking out my first attempt at a Javascript in-browser game. I was originally inspired by the fishing minigame from Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. Instead of catching fish from a river, though, the player is acting as Mr. Trash Wheel, a solar-powered trash collection machine deployed to clean up the Baltimore River. 
# Players navigate the game with the up and down keys. The goal of the game is to catch as much trash as possible! If you miss more than 10 pieces of trash, the game ends. 
# In future versions of this game I would like to incorporate more kinds of trash which are randomly displayed, as well as introduce new levels where the game gets increasingly harder (i.e. the trash will flow faster and more will be generated at once). 
# Each level will be in a new river, coming from the list of the 7 most polluted rivers in the US, found at https://theearthproject.com/most-polluted-rivers-in-the-us/
# These rivers are Ohio River, Mississippi, Tennessee, Cuyahoga, Houston, New. 
# Many thanks to the creators of the assets for the trash at ghostpixxells.itch.io; Chutipon Pattanatitinon on Unsplash for the original photo of flowing water which I pixelated and brought into this game, and especially to Franks Labratory on YouTube for the multiple tutorials I referenced for animation and collision detection. All links below will connect you to the source material.
